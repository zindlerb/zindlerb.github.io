		    <p id="c5253580-e742-4cfa-ae28-7ba0071573aa" class="">Recently I
		      have been investigating how to improve flowchart editing tools.
		      Flowcharts and graphs are a powerful tool for understanding complex
		      non-linear systems but they can be difficult to manipulate on
		      computers. There are a few good digital tools for editing
		      flowcharts like <a href=
		                         "https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a> and
		      <a href="https://whimsical.co">Whimsical</a>. But, I feel they
		      could be improved by limiting the time spent on diagram layout and
		      providing support for complex written content.</p>
		    <p id="a17f020d-3e40-4316-932f-c65bb877ed61" class="">In this
		      article I'll be using the <a href=
		                                   "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Graph Theory</a>
		      terminology of nodes and edges to describe flowcharts. Nodes are
		      the boxes in the flowchart and edges are the connecting lines.</p>

		    <p id="0172e4c2-31a0-407b-8b83-600c310c3271" class="">Currently if
		      I need a flowchart for something like a new software architecture
		      or to decompose a large project into dependent subtasks I have a
		      couple of options:</p>
		    <p id="33ef4657-fc07-4ac6-9a32-21dc3baf12e0" class="">Whiteboards -
		      I can draw it out on a Whiteboard. Whiteboards are by far the best
		      interface for producing diagrams. They have infinite flexibility
		      and instant feedback. The main downsides are pictures of
		      whiteboards can't be updated, it can be tedious to organize large
		      detailed diagrams, and it is difficult to use whiteboards
		      remotely.</p>
		    <p id="55cb1d05-49aa-466a-8a8f-4c8024254698" class="">Flowchart
		      Tools - There are many tools for editing flowcharts online like
		      <a href="https://whimsical.co">Whimsical</a>, <a href=
		                                                       "https://plectica.com">Plectica</a>, <a href=
		                                                                                               "https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>, and
		      <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/">Lucidchart</a>. I think
		      Whimsical and Omnigraffle are well made and offer a large amount of
		      flexibility. But, I spend too much time manually managing the chart
		      layout. <strong>This is especially noticeable when diagrams are
		        modified.</strong> Modifying a large diagram results in lots of
		      shuffling. Adding or moving a node often makes the rest of the
		      chart unpresentable. The user is then forced to re-organize all of
		      the connecting edges. Additionally, typing long sections of text
		      often cause nodes to overlap. This forces the user to switch from
		      writing to move nodes back into a presentable layout.</p>
		    <div class="indented">
		      <p id="efe728ee-a45c-4bb5-83b7-511b08a522e8" class="">Below is an
		        example of me trying to switch a horizontal flowchart to a vertical
		        layout in Whimsical. As I re-organize the chart is becomes a
		        jumbled mess of connecting edges.</p>
		      <div id="d5cdce59-4aaf-412b-8977-eed4054e9835">

		      </div>
		      <p id="64508ba8-82ff-445c-85f6-986840981ce4" class="">All of the
		        existing chart editing tools force the user to manipulate the
		        document at the pixel level. You need to specify where edges
		        connect to a node, how the edges are laid out and the exact pixel
		        position of the nodes. If anything changes the user is responsible
		        for fixing the layout.</p>
		      <p id="5a8847f5-ab37-49e8-bd16-93a94b478ef7" class="">Another issue
		        is flowchart tools seem to be oriented around writing a few lines
		        per node. I would like to express complex information like a
		        software system specification inside a node. Putting complex
		        written ideas inside a node requires things like headers,
		        checklists, images, tables, and embedded content (Github, Figma,
		        etc.).</p>
		      <p id="3c306605-b74d-4820-a300-e92df9426511" class="">I do want to
		        give a shoutout to <a href="https://www.plectica.com">Plectica</a>.
		        Their layout model allows you to specify high level relationships
		        like "this node is connected to that node", without forcing you to
		        specify exactly where the edge connects to the node. My main gripes
		        with their tools are the interface is not good for high efficiency
		        editing, and the line drawing algorithm is a little wonky.</p>

		    <p id="cfe17ba9-720e-43ae-a3ae-31a1d7fd270e" class="">Graphviz -
		      <a href="https://www.graphviz.org">Graphviz</a> is a command line
		      tool for visualizing graphs. The user only needs to specify the
		      nodes and edges of the graph and the program will try to lay it out
		      in a presentable manner. Graphviz is really great but it has a high
		      barrier to entry. You need to learn the Graphviz language, there
		      are lots of configuration options to understand, and if the graph
		      does't look right it's difficult to figure out how to fix it. Often
		      you are forced to use <a href=
		                               "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12934763/graphviz-edge-label-too-close-to-another-edge">
		        hacks</a> to get the graph to look presentable. Also, there is not
		      an easy way to share Graphviz programs. Given all of those
		      difficulties it can still be used in a business context. Here is an
		      example of p<a href=

		    <p id="a9c27a93-90db-488a-82ae-bb7277d1a37d" class="">None of the
		      current options provide a satisfactory experience. I would like to
		      have a chart drawing tool that lets me focus on the content and
		      relationships of the chart. I don't want to spend a lot of time
		      tweaking the chart layout. Additionally I want to be able to
		      express complex information inside the chart nodes. Essentially I
		      want a tool that has the editing capabilities of <a href=
		                                                          "https://notion.so">Notion</a> and the layout features of <a href=

		      decrease the amount of time it takes to create and modify an
		      aesthetically pleasing flowchart. In the following section I will
		      describe a hypothetical tool named Tidy. To flesh out the concepts
		      there are a few illustrative videos from a prototype I made.</p>
		    <h2 id="14cde3c1-3193-4148-8744-22e5461adffd" class="">Canvas
		      Layout</h2>
		    <p id="b3fb8266-b7af-485e-afda-eaf0265b9fcc" class="">The primary
		      difference of Tidy and current flowchart tools is the user has less
		      control over the layout. The chart edges must always connect to a
		      node or a piece of content and the user has no control over how the
		      edges are laid out. Where the edge connects and how the edge is
		      laid out is done automatically. Nodes cannot overlap. Here is an
		      example of the edge repositioning itself as the node moves:</p>

		    </div>
		    <p id="c3634c40-f1ec-47f6-9800-05f01fb430cf" class="">Similar to
		      Graphviz, the edges try to lay themselves out in the most
		      aesthetically pleasing position possible. For example edges will
		      never overlap nodes. The layout algorithm would likely follow
		      similar aesthetic criteria to the Graphviz Dot Algorithm.</p>
		    <blockquote id="99443659-ed43-442c-b221-cd017333cc1c" class="">A1.
		      Expose hierarchical structure in the graph. In particular, aim
		      edges in the same general direction if possible. This aids finding
		      directed paths and highlights source and sink nodes. A2. Avoid
		      visual anomalies that do not convey information about the
		      underlying graph. For example, avoid edge crossings and sharp
		      bends. A3. Keep edges short. This makes it easier to find related
		      nodes and contributes to A2. A4. Favor symmetry and balance. This

		    <p id="dc1c84b8-5d22-4826-a44d-baf920b97a63" class="">I'm still not
		      sure if it is possible to always layout the edges in such a way
		      that the user doesn't get annoyed. The user may need to be given
		      high level controls to manipulate the edges. Here is an example of
		      what it might look like to have edges move out of the way when they
		      overlap with a node.</p>

		      provide the ability to auto-layout a chart. There are many kinds of
		      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing">graph layout
		        methods</a>. The most useful seems to be the hierarchical layout
		      used by the <a href=

		        great article</a> about the importance of mental graphs in

		    <p id="eb3b17f6-07d4-4c80-a6f5-355d8e82002d" class=""><em>"Graph
		        relationships exist at all levels of scale, from the data
		        dependencies between expressions in a function up to the
		        dependencies between publicly published packages. This is good news
		        for us: learning about one aspect of software structure reinforces
		        our ability to think about others. It also means that all
		        programmers eventually learn to think about graph relationships,
		        even if that skill remains entirely automatic and subconscious.
		        Programming requires understanding which functions call which other
		        functions, which modules import which other modules, and which
		        classes inherit from which other classes. Getting better at
		        programming means, in part, getting better at thinking through more

		        modules, examining them one by one."</em></p>
		    <p id="90067ad3-2133-4239-80f2-d61b9fdd509a" class="">When I design
		      a new system I usually use pencil and paper to trace out some of
		      these graph relationships. When I document the system I usually
		      write it up into a wiki like Notion. It would be interesting to see
		      if system specifications could be better expressed through graph
		      relationships with big chunky long form nodes. Current tools don't
		      support this very well because they don't allow for complex
		      formatting like headers or embedded code snippets.</p>
		    <p id="c1baef9f-29e7-442a-bab0-4bcf6e068a85" class="">In order to
		      support these of use cases I think it would be useful for Tidy to
		      have something similar to Notion's blocks. In Notion a block is an
		      atomic unit of content. It can be a paragraph, checkbox, code
		      snippet and many other things. They have a good writeup on blocks
		      <a href=
		         "https://www.notion.so/What-is-a-block-e88f2d5154734d00863e1f6b97f849e5">
		        here</a>.</p>
		    <p id="07f41a08-2249-4ce0-9163-022294fb81d2" class="">What is so
		      neat about blocks is even though they contain different kinds of
		      content they share the same affordances. All blocks can be
		      reordered, transformed into other blocks, linked to, commented on,
		      etc. The uniformity of affordances make blocks a powerful
		      primitive.</p>

		      of Notion's blocks would need to be modified because flowchart
		      editing is different from document editing. The main difference is
		      there are two layouts. The block layout inside a node and the
		      canvas layout outside a node.</p>
		    <p id="ef72af27-ec68-4d74-b3e4-1b1f9fa9838b" class="">A big design
		      challenge with introducing blocks is how to handle theses two
		      layouts. The user needs to be able to drag the node and the blocks
		      inside the node. The flowchart tool Plectica allows for nested
		      nodes and handles the nested dragging via padding around the nodes.
		      In practice, I found it hard to select the text areas with the
		      mouse and it created a lot of visual clutter.</p>

		      be nested inside other nodes? In Notion everything is a block and

		      the user.</p>
