<p class="">Very rough notes on the Distill Pub Article <a href=
"https://distill.pub/2020/communicating-with-interactive-articles/">
Communicating with Interactive Articles</a>.</p>
<p class="">Really good survey of the state of interactive essays.
Lots of interesting essays that I would like to give a read.
<a href=
"https://parametric.press/issue-01/unraveling-the-jpeg/">Unraveling
the JPEG</a> looked especially good.</p>
<p class="">How much are essays improved by interactivity? I do
think there are some essays genuinely aided by interactivity but
many examples felt like they would be better with high quality data
graphics replacing the interactive elements.</p>
<p class="">I was reminded of Bret Victor's skepticism of
interaction in information software from <a href=
"http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/#p154">Magic Ink</a></p>
<blockquote class="">Chris Crawford defines interaction as a
three-phase reciprocal process, isomorphic to a conversation: an
interactant&nbsp;listens&nbsp;to her
partner,&nbsp;thinks&nbsp;about what was said,
and&nbsp;speaks&nbsp;a response. Her partner then does the
same.&nbsp;For&nbsp;<em>manipulation</em>&nbsp;software,
interaction is perfectly suitable: the user views a visual
representation of the model, considers what to manipulate next, and
performs a manipulation. The software, in turn, inputs the user’s
manipulation request, updates the model, and displays the updated
representation. With good feedback and an effective means of
“speaking” to the software, this process can cycle smoothly and
rapidly. It mimics the experience of working with a physical tool.
Information software, by contrast, mimics the experience
of&nbsp;<em>reading</em>, not working. It is used for achieving an
understanding—constructing a model within the mind. Thus, the user
must&nbsp;<em>listen</em>&nbsp;to the software
and&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;about what it says… but any
manipulation happens mentally. The only reason to complete the full
interaction cycle and&nbsp;<em>speak</em>&nbsp;is to explicitly
provide some context that the software can’t otherwise infer—that
is, to indicate a relevant subset of information.&nbsp;For
information software, all interaction is essentially navigation
around a data space.</blockquote>
<p class="">One of the cited essays <a href=
"http://tomasp.net/coeffects/">Coeffects: Context-aware programming
languages</a> allows the user to choose how much content to show by
default:</p>

<p class="">This interactivity is similar to what might be done via
graphic design via highlighting an low-lighting information. This
made me think about the hierarchy of tools a designer has for
organizing information. Some methods that came to mind (sorted from
least to most user effort):</p>
<p class="">Non-interactive</p>
<ul class="bulleted-list">
<li>Type heirarchy</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bulleted-list">
<li>Highlighting/Lowlighting text</li>
</ul>
<p class="">Interactive</p>
<ul class="bulleted-list">
<li>Hovering to reveal content</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bulleted-list">
<li>Clicking to reveal + hide content</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bulleted-list">
<li>Navigating to another page via link</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p class="">Thinking about the revealing and hiding content, lead
me to think about the boundaries of "Browsers" and "Editors" and
"Documents".</p>
<p class="">"Documents" being knowledge that someone has posted in
some form like a webpage.</p>
<p class="">"Browsers" being a program for viewing documents</p>
<p class="">"Editors" being a program for manipulating
documents</p>
<p class="">For an interactive article the "document" is the
webpage and the "browser" is the web browser. The interactive
articles are taking on a lot of the responsibility of the
interaction.</p>
<p class="">What if this responsibility was shifted onto the
"browser". For example what if my browser for webpages looked more
like <a href="https://www.liquidtext.net/">LiquidText</a>? And I
could scrunch up sections of text. This accomplishes a similar
purpose to allowing the reader to show and hide text via buttons in
the article. But if the browser gives me this capability I can do
it anywhere.</p>

<p class="">But shifting this behaviour to the browser may mean
constraining what is possible in the "document".</p>
<p class="">How would having a "browser" like <a href=
"https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes">Andy
Matuschak's notes</a> effect the degree of interaction needed in an
essay? Do you need to do as much showing and hiding if cost of
navigating a link is not as high?</p>

<p class="">Programs like Notion and Roam seem to be a fusion of
"browser", "document", and "editor". But, that comes at the expense
of constraining the layouts that are possible.</p>
<hr>
<p class="">How can we build tools that democratize the creation of
interactive articles?</p>
<p class="">It could be hugely beneficial for domain experts to be
able to author interactive articles without programming knowledge.
But, the space of interactivity is so wide. It's hard to create a
tool for creating interactive "explorables" that is both flexible
and powerful.</p>
<p class="">We still don't know what makes a good interactive essay
so the range of expressible interaction should ideally be as wide
as possible.</p>
<p class="">One approach may be to first nail how do we give
non-programmers and non-designers the ability to control the layout
and organization of their content.</p>
<p class="">Currently someone can't add Tufte style references to
their blogpost without being reasonably familiar with html/css.</p>
<p class="">Forget the interactivity of the <a href=

Communicating with Interactive Articles</a>, the layout is
wonderful. The gallery of interactive articles:</p>

<p class="">Non-programmers still can't take full advantage of the
non-interactive elements of the web in order to communicate their
ideas.</p>
<p class="">There are some tools that are touching on this. Notion
seems to be the strongest among them. But, Notion has a symmetry
between reading and writing. I believe this limits complexity of
layouts a tool like Notion can produce.</p>
